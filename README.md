# 2D-Array---DS
This code solves the 2D Array - DS problem by finding the maximum hourglass sum in a 6x6 2D array. It scans all possible 3x3 hourglass patterns by iterating through valid starting positions and calculates each hourglass's element sum. The algorithm tracks the highest sum encountered, efficiently exploring all 16 possible hourglass configurations in the array.
